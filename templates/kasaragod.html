                <p>Around 16 km to the south of northernmost district in Kerala, Kasaragod, lies the massive Bekal Fort.
                  It is among the biggest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained throughout the years. It
                  rises to 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning 35km. Much effort has been
                  put to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach. People flock to these spots in
                  great numbers. Situated comfortably on steep hills by the sea, the fort provides for an imposing view
                  from the beach. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape, it is amongst the most visited
                  sites in Kerala.</p>

                <p>There are many factors that have added to the popularity of the site. An observation tower fitted
                  with beautiful peepholes, the Anjaneya Temple with its famous masonry and two Theyyam sculptures built
                  from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque built by Tipu Sultan and various
                  underground passageways are also important places in the area. A rock garden was built using laterite
                  in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself. Trees have been planted on the beach
                  along with the construction of a splendid walkway which makes it easier to traverse the beach and
                  enjoy its sights. At night, the entire place is lit up with special lights that add a whole new
                  dimension to its beauty.</p>

                <p>Ranipuram is the QUEEN OF MALABAR As it stands tall at 1048 meters on the western ghats with a verity
                  of fl aura and fauna.Lots of Variety species are found in ranipuram as it is also a bio diversity
                  hotspot lies at the western ghats. Wild life like Elephants , boar, Deers, birds , butterflies are in
                  a huge number The Woody adventures Ranipuram provides Hadr and soft treks through this forest.
                  Evidence of pre-settlement traditions exist in the form of 'Theyyam', a folk dance to please the
                  mother goddess held in the month of May. This place was formerly known as Madathumala until the 1970s,
                  when it was purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Kottayam for the purpose of settlement. Settlers
                  renamed it as Ranipuram in memory of the virgin mother.</p>
                <p>There are two trekking routes available through the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests. Part
                  of the way the climb is assisted by cut steps. The ambiance of the forest trail is remarkable and once
                  you reach the "Mani" (grass covered hilltop) the view is superb. The undulating cloud-topped hills
                  stretch up to the plains and ocean on the horizon. This is unexplored territory for the nature
                  enthusiast and birdwatcher. Butterflies are in abundance and birds of the evergreen biotope like the
                  black eagle,crested serpent eagle and little spider hunter common. Elephants pay visits in the summer
                  months and leopards have been sighted in the not-too-distant past. The Ranipuram forest should be
                  declared as a wild life sanctuary by Kerala Forest Department to merge with borders of Thalakavery
                  wild life sanctuary in Karnataka. The proposed Ranipuram Wildlife Sanctuary may protect and maintain
                  overall biodiversity of the area in a better way. The place holds immense potential for ecotourism and
                  may develop into a premier hill station in Kerala with the judicious development of amenities. Tourist
                  cottages are available here provided by the KTDC and some private players have entered the scene. The
                  proposed Ranipuram Wildlife sanctuary will be a boon to tourism development in Kasaragod district.</p>
